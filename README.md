# Pah-Pah

**Multiplayer hide & seek videogame used to demonstrate common cheating techniques in videogames.**

## Purpose

Pah-Pah is a simple multiplayer hide & seek game built to **showcase and analyze how players can cheat** in typical game scenarios. This repo contains the game project and examples of cheating vectors that can occur in networked games.

This is *not* meant to be a polished commercial game, but a product of my Bachelor's thesis. It is a demo/proof-of-concept for education, testing, and security research.

## Features

- Multiplayer hide & seek gameplay  
- Demonstrations of common cheating techniques (speed hacks, state tampering, etc.)  
- Unity project with networking logic  
- Basic assets and scenes to inspect and modify

## Requirements

- Unity (version used in development should be documented here)  
- A machine capable of running Unity Editor  
- (Optional) A network environment or local loopback for multiplayer testing

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/marinprusac/Pah-Pah.git
